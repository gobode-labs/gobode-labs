# Gobode Labs: Engineering Secure Intelligence

### Founder and Software Architect: Eduardo Morales
> "Software shouldn't just run; it should defend its own logic."

I have devoted my life to visualizing software as a living mathematical structure. My focus is on developing sophisticated, **self-defending code** that applies mathematical rigor to optimize performance and security.
